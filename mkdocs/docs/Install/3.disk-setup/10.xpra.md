# Xpra

xpra is an alternative to RDP
It has super fast almost native performance compared to rdp when I tested it against xfce
Also you can connect from the client just using a web browser (or the proper client software)

Currently I've got the latest version of xpra setup via an overlay

acct-group/xpra-0-r2-1
=www-apps/xpra-html5-17
=x11-wm/xpra-6.2.3

```bash
# Seems to partially work creates a new session
xpra start :100 --start="xfce4-session" --bind-tcp=0.0.0.0:10000

xpra start :100 --start="konsole" --bind-tcp=0.0.0.0:10000
# nearly works
# desktop doesnt resize?
xpra start-desktop :100 --resize-display="1920x1080" --start="startplasma-wayland" --bind-tcp=0.0.0.0:10000

# List active sessions
xpra list

# TODO
# this might work
xpra shadow wayland-0 --bind-tcp=0.0.0.0:10000
```

Running this while plasma is started up nearly works.
```bash
xpra shadow wayland-0 --bind-tcp=0.0.0.0:10000
```

But once you connect via the client to port 10000 via a web browser a prompt shows up on the kde desktop
asking if you want to confirm that remote access is allowed
So I think I need another form of command similar to this but to allow xpra instead
not quite sure what to replace `org.kde.krdpserver` with though
```bash
flatpak permission-set kde-authorized remote-desktop org.kde.krdpserver yes
```
