## Install

First we need to install eselect-repository
```bash
emerge app-eselect/eselect-repository
```

## Create Repo

Next to create a local ebuild repo

```bash
eselect repository create local
cd /var/db/repos/local/
```

## Xpra

acct-group/xpra-0-r2-1
=www-apps/xpra-html5-17
=x11-wm/xpra-6.2.3

currently some sort of python depend issue with xpra when installed?

look at pulseaudio, rustup, kde-apps-meta

kde-apps-meta is pulling in qtwebengine from some place
