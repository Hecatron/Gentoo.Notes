# NVME Disk Setup

## NVME Disk Modes

With Nvme SSD Disks they can present themselves to the host operating system in one of two ways

  * Traditional SCSI Disk - /dev/sdx devices
  * Nvme Disk - /dev/nvme0n1

The type shown seems to be determned by Bios settings for the machine.
In the case of a S20 Mini PC for example, by default the windows disk is set to /dev/sdx
But an additional nvme disk defaults to /dev/nvme0n1

## Parition Table Types

There are two different types of parition tables

  * GUID / GPT Type, used by UEFI firmware
  * MBR, used by MBR DOS/legacy BIOS

It's reasonable to say all modern machines these days use the GPT type now.
To determine the current partition type of an existing setup
```bash
sudo gdisk -l /dev/nvme0n1
```

## File System Types

For the file system generally there are two options

  * ext4
  * XFS

XFS seems to have less impact on cpu load and can be slightly faster overall
But there's some suggestion that it doesn't recover as well on power failure.
If using a small mini PC then keeping the cpu load down would seem to be a good thing.
For the rest of this documentation I'll be using XFS

## Partition Table Setup

The following partition table is what I'll be using for this example:
Typically the Swap partition should be around 2 x RAM for hibernation and suspending

| Device         | File System | Size              | Description |
| -------------- | ----------- | ----------------- | ----------- |
| /dev/nvme0n1p1 | vfat        | 1Gb               | EFI system partition (used for Boot) |
| /dev/nvme0n1p2 | linux swap  | 64Gb              | Used for Linux Memory Swap |
| /dev/nvme0n1p3 | XFS         | Remainder of Disk | Root Partition |

The following assumes setup on a new blank disk

Warning this will erase all data on the target disk

First lets enter the fdisk menu, make sure to do this as root.
We will also remove any existing partitions and assign the drive a new GPT disk label
```bash
# Make sure we are root
su
# Lets jump into the fisk menu
fdisk /dev/nvme0n1
# Remove all partitions and Create a new GPT disklabel
g
```

Next lets create the first EFI partition which is need for booting from a GPT disk
This needs to be FAT32
```bash
# Create the initial EFI partition
n, <enter>, <enter>, +1G
# Change the partition type to EFI
t, 1
```

Next lets setup the swap partition
```bash
# Setup the swap partition
n, <enter>, <enter>, +64G
# Change the partition type to Linux Swap
t, 2, 19
```

Next the root partition, this will use the remainder of the disk
```bash
# Setup the root partition
n, <enter>, <enter>, <enter>
# Change the partition type to Linux
t, 3, 23
```

Finally display the table then write it to disk
```bash
# display the new table
p
# save changes
w
```

## file System Setup

Next we need to format each of the partitions
```bash
# format the EFS System Partition
mkfs.vfat -F 32 /dev/nvme0n1p1
# Setup the swap partition
mkswap /dev/nvme0n1p2
# Format the root partition
mkfs.xfs /dev/nvme0n1p3
```
